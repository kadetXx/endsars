I am a Nigerian citizen and currently participating in peaceful protests offline and online towards ending police brutality in Nigeria. Over the years, SARS (Special Anti-robbery Squad), a unit of the Nigerian Police Force created to fight crimes such as kidnapping and armed robbery, has been involved in several crimes against humanity and violation of human rights. 

As enshrined in our constitution and the UDHR, we as citizens have a right to peaceful protests which we have exercised in the past week. 

Unfortunately, Amb. H. Coomassie, a member of the Canada Nigeria Community Development Association (CANCODA) made a video clip (https://twitter.com/DeleFarotimi/status/1317256669848608770) where he advised the president to use military force against peaceful protesters. In his words, “they should be handled with iron fists”.  He described the peaceful protests and demand for respect of lives as “nonsense”.

This is a man who ought to be an ambassador, promoting peace and your values. This shows he lacks empathy, and if he could make a video of himself and upload to the internet, who knows what he has done behind the camera.

This has also put your association in bad light and it is necessary you distance yourself from such statements and strip him of any position he currently holds including membership. 

Thank you.`),

  encodeURI(`Dear AGGN,

I would like to call your attention to an online statement released by one of your staff, Amb. Hussaini Coomasie, asking the Nigerian government to brutalize unarmed protesters demanding for justice and equity in the ongoing #EndSARS protest.

I am surprised that such a man works for your organization whose aim is to organize good governance projects in Africa and Germany. Please see the link to the video Hussaini Coomasie posted below:

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you!`),

Ich möchte Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf das Verhalten und die Gelassenheit Ihres Generaldirektors lenken. Sein Verhalten, seine Rede, sein Handeln und seine Reaktion in diesem Video (siehe Link)

https://twitter.com/DeleFarotimi/status/1317256669848608770?s=20

Es ist so schrecklich und respektlos. Er erwähnte, dass Bürger, die das Recht auf Protest hassen, Ann unmenschlich schlecht behandelt werden müssen, was meiner Meinung nach gegen die Mission und Vision dieser Organisation verstößt.

Ich bin absolut sicher, dass die Organisation nicht gerne mit einer solchen Person in Verbindung treten würde.

Ich wünsche, dass Sie diese Behauptung genau untersuchen.

Danke und Grüße !`),
