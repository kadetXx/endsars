*ATTENTION* ‼️‼️

Why The Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) Must be Scrapped
The Special Anti robbery Squad is a unit in the Nigerian Police Force originally formed to combat
robberies. Unfortunately, officers of the unit who mostly dress in mufti and carry Ak 47 guns in
unmarked cars have engaged in several cases of kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, illegal
raids, unlawful arrests, highhandedness, humiliation, unlawful detention and extortion (both
documented and undocumented). 

These activities are carried out under the pretext of looking
for thieves and fraudsters.
For no reason at all, many innocent Nigerians have been killed by these dangerous police
officers. Some of them are:

▪️ *Remi*, killed in Osogbo, September 15 2020
▪️ *Tina Ezwkwe*, 17 year old girl, killed for standing at a bus stop in Lagos in 2020
▪️ *Akinola Lasisi*, 33 year old man killed in Sagamu, Ogun State
▪️ *Femi Bello*, killed in Nasarawa in 2014
▪️ *Kolade Johnson*, who was killed while watching a football match in Lagos
▪️ *Tiamiyu Kazeem*, aka Kaka, footballer at Remo Stars FC, killed in Sagamu, Ogun State
▪️ *Ifeoma Abugu*, raped and murdered in a SARS Station in 2020
▪️ *Chibuike Anams*, killed while relaxing with a friend
▪️ *Christian Ugwuoke*, killed while attending his aunt’s wake keep
▪️ *Aneka Okorie*, killed for not paying bribe
▪️ *Ayomide Taiwo*, killed for not giving 50 naira bribe
▪️ *Godspower Edoha*, killed in his home
▪️ These are just some of the hundreds of innocent Nigerian youths killed by SARS officers.

For many years, Nigerians have protested and written petitions for the SRAS unit to be
scrapped but nothing has changed. After numerous failed promises from the federal
Government and reforms that did not change anything, young Nigerians are protesting in many
cities and the protest is attracting international attention. Nigerians in the Diaspora are also
joining on social media. 

We need everyone to join us this time around so that this unit can be
scrapped once and for all because the officers have proven that they are beyond being
reformed. We know that the entire force needs to be overhauled but this killer squad must go
first. Please join us at these protests, encourage us with your voice and money, lobby and talk
to your friends in power, and release your wards to protest. We are all that we have, our voices
must be heard.
Signed, Millions of Nigerian Youths Protesting
